1. What is the purpose of a breakpoint?
It stops the code running at that point so you can look various aspects of the code, such as properties of variables, at the point in which the breakpoint has been inserted.

2. Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?
No, it runs the debugger console.

3. How do we debug the next line of code?
Use Step Into to move forward a line.

4. What does the step into command do?
Executes each line one at a time. This is in contrast to features such as step over, which let you move past it without looking at it (it still runs though)

5. What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?
Evaluate code fragment allows you to evaluate multiple expressions whereas evaluate expression only allows you to  evaluate that particular one.
